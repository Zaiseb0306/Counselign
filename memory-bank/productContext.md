## Product Context

### Problem
Students need timely access to counseling services. Manual scheduling and fragmented communication cause delays and missed sessions.

### Users and needs
- Students: discover services, request appointments, view schedules, receive updates
- Counselors: manage availability, approve/track sessions, access history
- Admins: manage users, announcements, events, and oversight/reporting

### Core flows
1) Student logs in → requests appointment → receives confirmation/updates
2) Counselor reviews queue → approves/schedules → conducts session → records outcome
3) Admin posts announcements/events → users see targeted updates

### UX principles
- Clarity: simple navigation for Students vs Admin/Counselor areas
- Feedback: confirmations, statuses, and errors are visible and actionable
- Accessibility: readable typography and contrast; keyboard-friendly

### Content & IA
- Landing and login
- Admin dashboard: users, counselors, appointments, announcements, events, reports
- User area: request/view appointments, messages, profile

### Non-functional goals
- Reliability and data integrity
- Role-based security
- Reasonable performance on shared hosting/XAMPP
