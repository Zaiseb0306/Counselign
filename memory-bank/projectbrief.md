## Project Brief

### Project name
UGC Counseling System (CodeIgniter4)

### Purpose
Provide an online platform for students to book counseling appointments, view announcements/events, and communicate with counselors; and for admins/counselors to manage users, schedules, announcements, and reports.

### Objectives
- Enable authenticated users to request, view, and manage appointments
- Allow admins/counselors to approve, schedule, and track sessions
- Publish announcements and events to targeted audiences
- Maintain user profiles and roles (admin, counselor, student)
- Generate history and basic reports for oversight

### Stakeholders
- Students (primary end users)
- Counselors (service providers)
- Admins (system operators)
- University leadership/IT (oversight)

### Scope (Initial)
- Authentication and session management
- User role-based access (Admin, Counselor, Student)
- Appointments flow (request → approval → completion)
- Announcements and events management
- Messaging/notifications
- Basic reporting/history views

### Out of scope (Initial)
- Advanced analytics/BI
- External SSO integration
- Mobile apps
- Payment processing

### Success metrics
- Reduced no-show rate and faster time-to-appointment
- Successful creation/approval/completion of appointments without errors
- High reliability and low error rate in logs
- Positive feedback from students and counselors

### Constraints & assumptions
- Runs on PHP (CodeIgniter4) with MySQL/MariaDB
- Deployed under XAMPP on Windows for development
- Uses server-side rendering with CI4 Views plus vanilla JS

### High-level risks
- Data privacy and access control
- Scheduling conflicts/resource management
- Email deliverability for notifications
