## Counselor Time Format Standardization

**12-Hour Format Implementation:**
- **Database Storage**: `time_scheduled` field in `counselor_availability` table now stores 12-hour format with meridian labels
- **Format Examples**: "9:00 AM-11:30 AM", "1:30 PM-3:00 PM", "7:00 AM-5:00 PM"
- **Input Handling**: Counselor profile time selects populate with 12-hour format options
- **Display Consistency**: All availability displays show 12-hour format across admin, counselor, and student views
- **Backward Compatibility**: System handles both 12-hour and 24-hour formats for existing data

**Updated Controllers:**
- `App\Controllers\Counselor\Availability`: Handles 12-hour format validation and storage
- `App\Controllers\Student\Appointment`: Enhanced time parsing for counselor availability checking
- `App\Controllers\Admin\AdminsManagement`: Updated time slot availability checking for 12-hour format

**Updated Frontend:**
- `public/js/counselor/counselor_profile.js`: Modified time handling functions for 12-hour format
- `public/js/utils/timeFormatter.js`: Already supports 12-hour format conversion (existing)

## Counselor Follow-up Sessions (API)

Routes (under `counselor` group):

- `GET counselor/follow-up` → `FollowUp::index` (view)
- `GET counselor/follow-up/completed-appointments` → `FollowUp::getCompletedAppointments` (query: `search` - optional)
- `GET counselor/follow-up/sessions` → `FollowUp::getFollowUpSessions` (query: `parent_appointment_id`)
- `GET counselor/follow-up/availability` → `FollowUp::getCounselorAvailability` (query: `date`)
- `POST counselor/follow-up/create` → `FollowUp::createFollowUp`
- `POST counselor/follow-up/complete` → `FollowUp::completeFollowUp` (form: `id`)
- `POST counselor/follow-up/cancel` → `FollowUp::cancelFollowUp` (form: `id`, `reason`)

Controller: `App\Controllers\Counselor\FollowUp`

**Search Functionality:**
- Search parameter: `?search=<term>` in `getCompletedAppointments`
- Searches across: student_id, username, email, first_name, last_name, preferred_date, preferred_time, consultation_type, purpose, reason
- Returns filtered appointments with search_term in response

**Display Enhancement:**
- **Purpose Field**: Displays appointment purpose with bullseye icon (conditional rendering)
- **Reason Field**: Displays appointment reason with clipboard-list icon (conditional rendering)  
- **Description Field**: Displays appointment description with file-text icon (conditional rendering)
- **Data Source**: Controllers return `appointments.*` with all appointment fields including purpose, reason, and description
- **Frontend**: Enhanced `public/js/counselor/follow_up.js` to display these fields in appointment cards

## Admin Follow-up Sessions (API)

Routes (under `admin` group):

- `GET admin/follow-up-sessions` → `FollowUpSessions::index` (view)
- `GET admin/follow-up-sessions/completed-appointments` → `FollowUpSessions::getAllCompletedAppointments` (query: `search` - optional)
- `GET admin/follow-up-sessions/sessions` → `FollowUpSessions::getFollowUpSessions` (query: `parent_appointment_id`)

Controller: `App\Controllers\Admin\FollowUpSessions`

**Search Functionality:**
- Search parameter: `?search=<term>` in `getAllCompletedAppointments`
- Searches across: student_id, username, email, first_name, last_name, preferred_date, preferred_time, consultation_type, purpose, reason, counselor_name
- Returns filtered appointments with search_term in response

**Key Differences from Counselor Version:**
- Admin shows ALL completed appointments (no counselor filtering)
- Read-only view - no create/cancel/complete functionality
- Same UI/UX as counselor version but without action buttons
- Admin can view follow-up sessions for any completed appointment
- Admin search includes counselor name field

## Student Follow-up Sessions (API)

Routes (under `student` group):

- `GET student/follow-up-sessions` → `FollowUpSessions::index` (view)
- `GET student/follow-up-sessions/completed-appointments` → `FollowUpSessions::getCompletedAppointments` (query: `search` - optional)
- `GET student/follow-up-sessions/sessions` → `FollowUpSessions::getFollowUpSessions` (query: `parent_appointment_id`)

Controller: `App\Controllers\Student\FollowUpSessions`

**Search Functionality:**
- Search parameter: `?search=<term>` in `getCompletedAppointments`
- Searches across: student_id, username, email, first_name, last_name, preferred_date, preferred_time, consultation_type, purpose, reason, counselor_name, counselor_first_name, counselor_last_name
- Returns filtered appointments with search_term in response

**Key Features:**
- Student shows only their own completed appointments (student_id filtering)
- Read-only view - no create/cancel/complete functionality
- Same UI/UX as counselor version but without action buttons
- Security validation ensures students can only access their own appointments

- **Description Field**: Displays appointment description with file-text icon (conditional rendering)
- **Counselor Name**: Displays counselor name with user-md icon (conditional rendering)
- **Data Source**: Controllers return `appointments.*` with all appointment fields including purpose, reason, and description
- **Frontend**: Enhanced `public/js/student/follow_up_sessions.js` to display these fields in appointment cards

Models:
- `AppointmentModel` – base appointments
- `FollowUpAppointmentModel` – follow-up sessions, fields include `status`, `reason`, `follow_up_sequence`, `parent_appointment_id`

UI Logic (in `public/js/counselor/follow_up.js`):
- In sessions modal:
  - Hide/disable `Create New Follow-up` if any sessions exist; show/enable only when none exist
  - `Create Next Follow-up` enabled only on the last session when that last session is `completed`
  - Add `Mark as Completed` and `Cancel` buttons beside `Create Next Follow-up`
  - `Mark as Completed` disabled when the session is already `completed`
  - `Cancel` enabled only when the session is `pending`; opens a modal requiring a reason

Views:
- `app/Views/counselor/follow_up.php`
  - Added `cancelFollowUpModal` with reason textarea and CSRF hidden field

## Notifications Endpoints

Student
- GET `student/notifications` → `App/Controllers/Student/Notifications::index`
- GET `student/notifications/unread-count` → `...::getUnreadCount`
- POST `student/notifications/mark-read` → `...::markAsRead`

Counselor
- GET `counselor/notifications` → `App/Controllers/Counselor/Notifications::index`
- GET `counselor/notifications/unread-count` → `...::getUnreadCount`
- POST `counselor/notifications/mark-read` → `...::markAsRead`

Notifications Model
- `NotificationsModel::getRecentNotifications(userId, lastActiveTime)` aggregates events, announcements, appointments (by `student_id`), and messages (student↔counselor).
- `getUnreadCount(userId)` mirrors same sources since last activity.
## Counselor Routes (Appointments & Reports)

- Base group: `counselor` → namespace `App\Controllers\Counselor`
- New routes added (duplicates of admin):
  - `GET counselor/appointments` → `Counselor\Appointments::index` → view `counselor/appointments`
  - `GET counselor/appointments/view-all` → `Counselor\Appointments::viewAll` → view `counselor/view_all_appointments`
  - `GET counselor/appointments/scheduled` → `Counselor\Appointments::scheduled` → view `counselor/scheduled_appointments`
  - `GET counselor/appointments/scheduled/get` → `Counselor\Appointments::getScheduledAppointments` (JSON)
  - `GET counselor/appointments/getAll` and `GET counselor/appointments/getAppointments` → `Counselor\Appointments::getAppointments` (JSON)
  - `POST counselor/appointments/updateStatus` → `Counselor\Appointments::updateStatus`
  - `POST counselor/appointments/updateAppointmentStatus` → `Counselor\Appointments::updateAppointmentStatus`
  - `GET counselor/appointments/schedule` → `Counselor\Appointments::getCounselorSchedule` (JSON - returns counselor's availability schedule)
  - `GET counselor/appointments/get_all_appointments` → `Counselor\GetAllAppointments::index` (JSON for charts and listings - FIXED: now includes all appointment statuses)
  - `GET counselor/history-reports` → `Counselor\HistoryReports::index` → view `counselor/history_reports`
  - `GET counselor/history-reports/data` → `Counselor\HistoryReports::getHistoryData`
  - `GET counselor/history-reports/historical-data` → `Counselor\HistoryReports::getHistoricalData`

Views & Assets:
- Views duplicated under `app/Views/counselor/` for `appointments.php`, `scheduled_appointments.php`, `view_all_appointments.php`, `history_reports.php`
- JS duplicated to `public/js/counselor/` with counselor endpoints
- CSS duplicated via import wrappers in `public/css/counselor/`

Rejection Flow (Counselor Appointments):
- Pending appointment actions in `appointmentDetailsModal` now follow a strict modal sequence:
  1. Click `#rejectAppointmentBtn` → open `#rejectionReasonModal` (backdrop: static, keyboard: false).
  2. Enter reason → click `#confirmRejectionBtn` → open `#confirmationModal` with action `reject` and carry `data-reason`.
  3. Click `#confirmActionBtn` → call `updateAppointmentStatus(id, 'rejected', reason)`.
- Direct auto-reject from footer click is removed to prevent bypassing reason capture.

Admin Scheduled Appointments Calendar:
- Updated `app/Views/admin/scheduled_appointments.php` to use a two-column layout `csq-layout` with a right sidebar mini-calendar identical to the counselor view.
- Enhanced `public/js/admin/scheduled_appointments.js` to render a mini-calendar using the same logic as counselor, counting only approved appointments per day from `admin/appointments/scheduled/get`.
- Styling is shared via `public/css/admin/scheduled_appointments.css` which already contains `.csq-*` and calendar classes.

Access Control:
- All counselor controllers enforce `session('role') === 'counselor'`

## System Patterns

### Architecture
- Framework: CodeIgniter 4 (MVC)
- Entrypoint: `public/index.php`
- Routing: `app/Config/Routes.php`
- Controllers: `app/Controllers/**` (Admin, User, Auth, etc.)
- Models: `app/Models/**` (e.g., `UserModel`, `AnnouncementModel`)
- Views: `app/Views/**` (admin, user, landing)
- Assets: `public/css/**`, `public/js/**`, `public/Photos/**`
- Database: configured via `app/Config/Database.php`; sample `ugcsystem.sql`
- Sessions/Logs: `writable/session/`, `writable/logs/`

### Domain modules (observed from codebase)
- Authentication: `app/Controllers/Auth.php`, `Logout.php`, `UpdatePassword.php`, `ForgotPassword.php`
- Admin area: `app/Controllers/Admin/**` (dashboard, users, counselors, announcements, events, appointments, history reports, messaging)
- User area: `app/Views/user/**`, `public/js/user/**`
- Announcements/Events: controllers + models; list/detail views
- Appointments: admin and user flows; debug logs under `writable/appointments_debug.log`

### Patterns & conventions
- Controllers return views or JSON for API-style endpoints under Admin
- Models encapsulate DB access; validation via CI4 Validation config
- Flash/session usage for auth and feedback
- Server-rendered views with progressive enhancement via vanilla JS
- **CRITICAL**: Always separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their respective files and folders:
  - HTML structure goes in PHP view files (`app/Views/`)
  - CSS styles go in dedicated CSS files (`public/css/`)
  - JavaScript functions go in dedicated JS files (`public/js/`)
  - Never mix HTML, CSS, and JS in the same file
  - This promotes consistency, maintainability, and proper MVC architecture

### Security & middleware
- Filters configured in `app/Config/Filters.php` for auth/CSRF as applicable
- Content Security Policy in `app/Config/ContentSecurityPolicy.php`

### Error handling & logging
- CI4 logger per `app/Config/Logger.php`; logs in `writable/logs/*`
- Debugbar artifacts under `writable/debugbar/`

### Responsive Navigation Pattern (Header)
- On screens larger than 992px, the full navigation bar (`.navbar-collapse`) is displayed, and the custom toggle button (`.custom-navbar-toggler`) is hidden.
- On screens 991.98px and smaller, the full navigation bar is hidden, and the custom toggle button is displayed on the rightmost side of the header.
- The custom toggle button, when clicked, opens a side drawer (`.navbar-drawer`) containing the navigation links with vertically centered icons and text. An overlay (`.navbar-overlay`) is also activated to dim the background and prevent interaction with the main content.
- JavaScript functions (`toggleDrawer()`, `closeDrawer()`) in `public/js/landing.js` and `public/js/services.js` manage the opening and closing of this drawer and handle modal interactions from within the drawer.
- The "Back" button in `app/Views/services_page.php` has been moved outside of the collapsible navbar to ensure it is always visible, regardless of screen size.
- The heading hierarchy in `app/Views/services_page.php` has been revised to ensure semantic correctness, with all h1-h6 tags being lessened by one level and associated styles updated.
- The header of the services page has been adjusted to match the height of the landing page header through CSS modifications in `public/css/services.css`, ensuring a consistent visual experience.
- Team member names in the footer of `app/Views/landing.php` and `app/Views/services_page.php` are now clickable hyperlinks.
- All client-side fetch calls and redirects in `public/js/landing.js`, `public/js/user/user_dashboard.js`, and `public/js/user/user_profile.js` now utilize `window.BASE_URL` for dynamic path resolution, improving maintainability. The direct path to `admin_notifications.php` was also converted to a more appropriate `admin/notify` route.
- The client-side login redirection logic in `public/js/landing.js` and `public/js/user/user_dashboard.js` has been updated to prevent double `base_url()` concatenation by conditionally prepending `window.BASE_URL` only to relative paths.

### Services Page Responsive Design Pattern
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Implemented comprehensive responsive design with 5 breakpoints (1200px+, 992-1199px, 768-991px, 480-767px, <480px).
- **Grid Layouts**: 
  - Service cards: 3 columns (desktop) → 2 columns (tablet) → 1 column (mobile)
  - Support programs: 4 columns (desktop) → 3 columns (large tablet) → 2 columns (small tablet) → 1 column (mobile)
- **Typography Scaling**: Responsive font sizes for all headings and text elements that scale appropriately across screen sizes.
- **Content Adaptation**: Responsive padding, margins, and spacing adjustments for main content, cards, and CTA section.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Drawer functionality with JavaScript controls for opening/closing, overlay management, and keyboard navigation (ESC key).
- **Landscape Support**: Special responsive rules for mobile landscape orientation with 2-column layouts.
- **Code Structure**: Replaced inline styles with CSS classes for better maintainability and responsive control.

### Modal System Pattern
- **Landing Page Modals**: Uses Bootstrap 5 modals for login, signup, forgot password, contact, terms, and verification prompts.
- **User Dashboard Modals**: Consistent modal system implemented with separated concerns:
  - **HTML Structure**: `app/Views/modals/user_dashboard_modals.php` contains modal HTML components:
    - `confirmationModal`: For user confirmations (e.g., logout) with Cancel/Confirm buttons
    - `alertModal`: For error/success/warning messages with appropriate icons and styling
    - `noticeModal`: For informational notices with bell icon
  - **JavaScript Functions**: `public/js/modals/user_dashboard_modals.js` contains modal logic:
    - `openConfirmationModal(message, onConfirm)`: Shows confirmation dialog with callback
    - `openAlertModal(message, type)`: Shows alert with type-specific styling (success/error/warning/info)
    - `openNoticeModal(message, type)`: Shows notice with type-specific styling
- **Error Handling**: All `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()` calls replaced with modal functions for consistent UX
- **Styling**: Modals use Bootstrap 5 classes with custom icons (Font Awesome) and color-coded styling based on message type
- **Code Structure**: JavaScript functions separated from PHP modal file for consistent MVC architecture

### Counselor Dashboard Logout Pattern

### Validation & Filters (Auth-related)

- Server-side Validation (CI4):
  - Signup:
    - `userId`: required, regex_match[/^\\d{10}$/] (exactly 10 digits)
    - `email`: required, valid_email, is_unique[users.email]
    - `password`: required, min_length[8], complexity regex, matches[confirmPassword]
  - Login:
    - `user_id`: required, regex_match[/^\\d{10}$/] (exactly 10 digits)
    - `password`: required, min_length[8], complexity regex
    - Redirects based on role: user → `user/dashboard`, counselor → `counselor/dashboard`, admin → `user/dashboard`
  - Admin Verification:
    - `verify-admin`: requires `user_id`, `password`; verifies admin role and hashed password; sets session and redirects to `admin/dashboard` on success; if unverified, returns prompt redirect
  - Forgot Password:
    - `sendCode`: `input` required (valid email format OR exactly 10-digit `user_id` resolving to email)
    - `setPassword`: password required, min_length[8], complexity regex
  - Contact Form:
    - name, email (valid), subject, message are required

### Profile Email Validation Pattern

**Enhanced Email Validation Across All Profiles:**
- **Consistent Error Messages**: All profile update endpoints now return the same specific error message for duplicate emails: "This email is already registered to another account"
- **Performance Optimization**: Duplicate email checking only occurs when the email is actually being changed, avoiding unnecessary database queries
- **Type Safety**: Clear, descriptive variable names and proper error handling without ambiguous code patterns

**Implementation Details:**
- **Counselor Profile**: `app/Controllers/Counselor/Profile.php` - `updateProfile()` method
- **Student Profile**: `app/Controllers/Student/Profile.php` - `updateProfile()` method  
- **Admin Profile**: `app/Controllers/Admin/AdminProfileApi.php` - `updateProfile()` method

**Validation Flow:**
1. Validate email format using `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`
2. Check if email is being changed by comparing with current user email
3. If email is changing, query database for existing email with different user_id
4. Return specific error message if duplicate found
5. Proceed with update using `skipValidation(true)` to avoid model-level unique checks
