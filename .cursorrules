Project Intelligence for UGC Counseling System

Conventions
- Keep Memory Bank authoritative; update after meaningful changes
- Prefer clear, verbose naming in code edits; avoid cryptic abbreviations
- Respect CodeIgniter 4 MVC boundaries (controllers thin, models for data access)

Workflow preferences
- Small, incremental edits with clear commit messages
- After adding/modifying endpoints, update `systemPatterns.md` and `activeContext.md`
- After schema changes, reflect in `techContext.md` and `progress.md`

Guardrails
- Do not expose admin-only routes to unauthenticated users
- Validate/escape all user inputs; rely on CI4 Validation and Filters
- Use CI4 Logger for server-side errors; avoid echoing raw errors in views
